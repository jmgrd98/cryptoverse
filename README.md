# cryptoverse
 This is a web app for checking crypto prices and news.

It was made with React + Redux, as well as 2 crypto APIs from the RapidAPI Hub, which I'll be linking it down below:

API for fetching cryptocurrencies prices: https://rapidapi.com/Coinranking/api/coinranking1
API for fetching crypto news: https://rapidapi.com/microsoft-azure-org-microsoft-cognitive-services/api/bing-news-search1

The app was deployed on Vercel and you can check it out on this link: https://cryptoverse-gules.vercel.app/
